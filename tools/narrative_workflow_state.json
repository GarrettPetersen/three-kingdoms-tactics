    "He Jin": {
      "A": "1) Audience halls and inner court succession crisis - [narrative] Emperor Ling falls gravely ill, and He Jin becomes the key military power behind the throne through his position and his tie to Empress He. Jian Shuo and allied eunuchs attempt to control succession by isolating He Jin and elevating a rival line, but He Jin survives the trap and regains initiative at court.\n2) He Jin's headquarters and ministerial councils - [narrative] With open trust between civil officials and eunuchs broken, He Jin consults Yuan Shao, Cao Cao, and other advisers on how to purge the Ten Attendants. He Jin repeatedly hesitates between decisive action and palace compromise, showing both his formal authority and his political uncertainty.\n3) Capital approaches and provincial mustering routes - [map] To pressure the palace faction, He Jin authorizes calls for outside commanders and troops to move toward Luoyang. This geographic escalation shifts the conflict from closed-court intrigue toward a wider military-political confrontation.\n4) Palace decision chamber before the strike - [narrative] He Jin settles on a final anti-eunuch course, framing the move as restoration of imperial order rather than personal vendetta. The chapter leaves him at the brink of execution, with all factions armed and waiting for the next misstep.",
